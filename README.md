Hi! I'm Rizki. I'm a student, programmer, and an indie game developer.
My main programming language is C# (Unity API). I also worked with Javascript and C++ projects.
Made 6 games for 3 different platforms so far, and really looking forward to learn something new or improve current skills to the max.
